# Privacy policy (stub)

This is a minimal privacy policy stub describing how the GCU Dashboard app handles data when using offline biometric features.

1. What we collect
  - We may store small biometric descriptors (face embeddings) and profile image blobs locally on your device to enable offline biometric sign-in. These are only stored on your device and are not uploaded to our servers without your explicit consent.

2. Why we collect it
  - To allow offline attendance and sign-in functionality when no network is available.

3. User control
  - You can enable or disable biometric features in Settings → Offline & Biometric Settings.
  - You can permanently delete locally stored biometric data (images and descriptors) from the same settings page.

4. Retention
  - Local biometric data is retained on the device until you remove it. We recommend removing it before transferring or selling a device.

5. Contact
  - For privacy questions, contact privacy@example.com (replace with your organization contact).
